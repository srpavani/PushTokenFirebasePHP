> This project enables seamless push notification management using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), built entirely without third-party libraries or frameworks. It focuses on simplicity and efficiency for developers who need a lightweight, self-contained solution for sending and receiving notifications across platforms.

## How It Works

1 **User Subscription: Users can subscribe to receive notifications by granting permission directly in the browser.
2 **FCM Token Management: The system handles token generation, validation, and storage without external dependencies.
3 **Notification Delivery: Notifications are sent via Firebase Cloud Messaging and displayed using the browser's native notification API, ensuring compatibility and performance.
4 **Service Worker Integration: The project uses a Service Worker to manage notifications in the background.

### Improvements and Future Enhancements
The project is under active development, and future updates will focus on:

- [x] Notification Delivery: HTML 
- [x] Notification Delivery: Android.
- [x] Notification Delivery: IOS Notification.
- [x] Sending JWT to Firebase API  without third-party libraries or frameworks.
